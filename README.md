# Wi-Fine

A connectivity monitoring app, built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install`.

## Running

To run from source, run `npm start`.

## Compiling

Run `npm pack` to get an unpacked directory

Run `npm dist` to compile a single executable file

## Compatibility

Being based on Electron, it should work on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. I myself have set it up and tested it **only on Windows 10** so far.
